# Scrimblo's Sources

A couple of different browser sources for OBS and Streamlabs.

## Pokemon - 3D models of every Pokemon, shiny or regular, front and back.

I couldn't find any browser sources that had all Pokémon, so I made my own.

### Usage
Simply search for whatever Pokémon you need and copy the browser source given.
If anything is missing or there is any model you want added, let me know.

### Credit
Support and check out some of the people who did the actual work in getting the 3D models.

## Hunger/Sleep Tracker - Allow chatters to know how close to sleeping/eating you are.
24/7 Streamers or Subathons can be confusing on the viewers who don't track your eating and sleeping. I made an irl version of the minecraft tracker.

### Usage
This browser source in particular listens to your twitch chat mods

## Shamless Self Plugging

I'm gonna be live 24/7 all of November 2021, if you've got any questions or you want any browser sources made, hop in and let me know. I'm down for making more if you've got any cool ideas.
