# Scrimblo's Sources

A couple of different browser sources for OBS and Streamlabs.

## Pokemon - 3D models of every Pokemon, shiny or regular, front and back.

I couldn't find any browser sources that had all Pokémon, so I made my own.

### Usage
Simply search for whatever Pokémon you need and copy the browser source given. If you're a big brain and wanna switch existing browser sources without visiting the website, the naming conventions are simply the Pokémon's name and 2 through 4 for direction or shiny. For Example,

Pikachu = pikachu.gif, Shiny Pikachu = pikachu2.gif, Pikachu's back = pikachu3.gif, Shiny Pikachu's back = pikachu4.gif

If anything is missing or there is any model you want added, let me know.

## Hunger/Sleep Tracker
24/7 Streamers or Subathons can be confusing on the viewers who don't track your eating and sleeping. I made an irl version of the minecraft tracker.

### Usage
This browser source in particular listens to your twitch chat mods

## Shamless Self Plugging

I'm gonna be live 24/7 all of November 2021, if you've got any questions or you want any browser sources made, hop in and let me know. I'm down for making more if you've got any cool ideas.
